# Project FreeGUN
Project FreeGUN is a FOSS 2D shooter made in the Godot Engine. Everything in the game is free and open source; the code, art assests, etc. The goal of the project is to be a framework to be built upon for other games. The game is built around mouse and keyboard controls, and should work on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
