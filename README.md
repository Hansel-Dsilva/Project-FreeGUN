# Project FreeGUN
FreeGUN is a FOSS 2D shooter made in the Godot Engine. Everything in the game is free and open source; the code, art assests, etc. The goal of the project is to be both a fun game for people to play, and be a framework to be built upon for other games.

The game is currently built on Godot 3.0.6 stable, and plans to stay built on the current stable build of Godot as they are released. The game is built around mouse and keyboard controls, and should work on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## How to use
To use, clone the repository and open the project in Godot.
